{"result": "Korea, also known as South Korea or simply Korea, is an East Asian country situated on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula. It is a nation where Ulsan Metropolitan City, Saechon City, Chuncheon, Yangsan, and Ulsan are located, and where notable figures like Park Kyunho were born. Korea has been reporting many cases of COVID-19, with the disease spreading rapidly, and its daily new confirmed cases fluctuating between 300 to 400. Despite this, several top female golfers, including Go Jin-young, Park In-bee, and Kim Sei-young, are from Korea. As social distancing measures ease, many companies in Korea are considering adjusting their work models. Additionally, the Moderna vaccine will be supplied to Korea starting May 2021. Korea is also where Jeonbuk Province is located and where U.S. troops are stationed, including those in South Korea. Notably, Korea produces approximately 36 million tons of garlic annually.", "input": "\n당신은 아래 제공된 데이터를 바탕으로 종합적인 요약을 생성하는 데 도움이 되는 어시스턴트입니다.\n하나 또는 두 개의 엔터티와 엔터티 또는 엔터티 그룹과 관련된 설명 목록이 주어집니다.\n이 모든 설명을 하나의 종합적인 설명으로 연결하십시오. 모든 설명에서 수집된 정보를 반드시 포함해야 합니다.\n제공된 설명이 모순되는 경우, 모순을 해결하고 하나의 일관된 요약을 제공하십시오.\n3인칭으로 작성하고, 전체 문맥을 파악할 수 있도록 엔터티 이름을 반드시 포함하십시오.\n\n#######\n-데이터-\n엔터티: \"KOREA\"\n설명 목록: [\"\", \"Korea is a country in East Asia\", \"Korea is a country in East Asia where Ulsan Metropolitan City is located.\", \"Korea is a country in East Asia where many cases of COVID-19 have been reported.\", \"Korea is a country in East Asia where the disease has been spreading rapidly.\", \"Korea is a country where Saechon City is located\", \"Korea is a country where the event took place\", \"Korea is an East Asian country located on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula\", \"Korea is the country where Kimhaegonghang airport is located\", \"Korea is the country where Sejongsi is located\", \"Korea is the country where many companies are considering adjusting their work models as social distancing measures ease>\", \"Korea is the country where several top female golfers, including Go Jin-young, Park In-bee, and Kim Sei-young, are from.\", \"Korea is the country where the apartment price increase occurred\", \"Korea is where Chuncheon is located\", \"The country of South Korea where the Moderna vaccine will be supplied starting May 2021>\", \"The country where Jeonbuk Province is located\", \"The country where Park Kyunho was born and the Korean football team represented\", \"The country where Yangsan and Ulsan are located\", \"country where U.S. troops are stationed, including those in South Korea>\", \"대한민국\", \"한국은 고작 36만t의 마늘을 생산합니다\", \"한국의 코로나19 신규 확진자 수가 300∼400명대 안팎에서 등락을 거듭하고 있습니다.\"]\n#######\n출력:\n", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
